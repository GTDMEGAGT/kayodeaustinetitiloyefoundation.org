Firstly, it aimed to raise public awareness about craniofacial anomalies, conditions that can significantly impact the lives of those affected. Secondly, it sought to provide free healthcare access to underserved populations grappling with cleft and facial deformities, thereby addressing a critical gap in healthcare provision.<\/p>\n<p>The outreach holds a special place in the landscape of public health due its crucial role in addressing the prevalent issue of untreated cleft lip deformities in Nigeria, a condition that often leads to social stigma and health complications.<\/p>\n<p>During this impactful outreach, a total of 64 patients were screened, out of which 46 underwent transformative surgeries, including cleft and maxillofacial procedures. The\u00a0patients hailed from various states across Nigeria, underscoring the nationwide spread of cleft and facial deformities and the impact of the\u00a0initiative.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-57284\" src=\"https:\/\/tydanjumafoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/A-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tydanjumafoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/A-980x649.jpg 980w, https:\/\/tydanjumafoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/A-480x318.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nIn addition to providing surgical interventions, the outreach also focused on capacity building.
